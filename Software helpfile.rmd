## Optional: Signularity Container

A Singularity container is a self-contained OS image which will obtain all required software packages in the appropriate versions, and all R package dependencies (additional packages required by packages being installed by the user). It will also For most institutions, your IT department must implement the Singularity container. This is optional, but will install the recommended versions of JAGS and all R packages required for this exercise.

cluster 2.0.7.1  
factoextra 1.0.5  
tRophicPosition 0.7.7  
viridis 0.5.1  

# Advanced exercise:
R Version 3.5.1 or later  
RStudio Version 1.1.456 or later  
JAGS version 4.3.0 or later  

**R packages**  
rjags 4.8  
simmr 0.4.1  
dplyr 0.8.2  
ggplot2 3.2.0  

- Note: Some versions of R may produce an error during package installation stating that the package rtools must be installed. This message can be ignored.

## Installation

Each exercise contains code to install the R packages for that exercise. This may take a substantial amount of time. In particular, dplyr installation can take up to an hour or more on slow connections. If this is a concern, please ensure that dplyr has been pre-installed on each machine on which these exercises are to be used. The code will check for and skip intallation of any packages which are already installed.

## Tested versions

These exercises were tested on R versions 3.5.1 (Windows) and 3.6.2 (Windows and Mac), and RStudio versions 1.1.456 (Windows), using the package versions listed above as the minimum required. JAGS version 4.3.0 was tested on Windows and Mac.

## JAGS vs rjags

JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is a standalone software program which was developed to analyze Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. It must be installed on each computer on which the *advanced* exercise will be used. It is not needed for the introductory exercise. The R package rjags is your interface to JAGS. Package rjags solves isotope mixing models using the framework provided by JAGS. The exercise has been tested on JAGS version 4.3.0 using rjags version 4.8. Find the JAGS readme at http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/ and rjags documentation at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/rjags.pdf
